# Notebook: Improving Conversion on Marketplaces
# This notebook follows the CRISP-DM framework to explore, model, and evaluate conversion optimization strategies in online marketplaces.

# Step 1: Business Understanding
"""
Goal: Improve conversion rates in a two-sided marketplace (e.g., Airbnb, Amazon, Fiverr).
Definition: Conversion = when a user completes a meaningful action (e.g., booking, purchase, inquiry).
Objective: Identify patterns in user and listing behavior to predict conversion likelihood.
"""

# Step 2: Data Understanding
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example placeholder for loading data
data = pd.read_csv('data/raw/sample_marketplace_data.csv')
data.head()

# Exploratory plots (placeholder)
sns.histplot(data['conversion'], kde=False)
plt.title('Conversion Distribution')
plt.show()

# Step 3: Data Preparation
# Placeholder for cleaning and feature engineering
# e.g., handling nulls, encoding categories, feature scaling

# Step 4: Modeling
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score

# Placeholder modeling steps
X = data.drop('conversion', axis=1)
y = data['conversion']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]))

# Step 5: Evaluation & Scenario
# Example scenario prediction
# "User X viewed 3 listings â€” which one is most likely to convert?"

# scenario_data = X_test.iloc[:3]  # Placeholder
# predictions = model.predict_proba(scenario_data)[:, 1]
# scenario_data['conversion_probability'] = predictions
# scenario_data

# Step 6: Conclusion
"""
Key takeaways:
- Listing characteristics such as price, number of images, and description length strongly influence conversion.
- Predictive models can help prioritize high-converting listings or optimize recommendations.
Next steps:
- Improve model with hyperparameter tuning.
- Incorporate time-based user session features.
