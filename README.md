# Improving Conversion on Marketplaces

## Motivation
Online marketplaces thrive on successful user-to-product matches. In this project, we aim to explore how user behavior and listing characteristics influence conversion rates, and build predictive models to improve these outcomes.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains the main Jupyter notebook with EDA, modeling, and results.
- `data/`: Folder for raw and processed datasets.
- `images/`: Visual assets generated during analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: All required Python libraries.
- `docs/`: Optional notes or documentation.

## CRISP-DM Approach

- **Business Understanding:** Identify key features that influence marketplace conversions.
- **Data Understanding:** Explore user, product, and interaction datasets.
- **Data Preparation:** Clean and engineer meaningful features.
- **Modeling:** Train classification models to predict conversion probability.
- **Evaluation:** Measure performance using accuracy, recall, precision, F1.
- **Deployment/Scenario:** Present a real-world use case of predicting conversion likelihood.

## Key Findings
- [To be filled after analysis â€” e.g., "Listings with professional photos and recent activity converted 34% more on average."]

## Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, xgboost
- shap, plotly
